## 1. Basic Features of Django Framework

1. **Database Flexibility**: Django makes switching databases a breeze, allowing you to adapt your application to different database systems effortlessly.

2. **User-Friendly Admin Interface**: Its built-in admin interface simplifies managing your web app's content and data, making it accessible even for non-technical users.

3. **Rich Ecosystem**: With thousands of additional packages and extensions available, you can easily enhance your Django project with a wide range of features and functionalities.

4. **Scalability**: Django is designed to handle growth, making it suitable for both small projects and large, scalable web applications. It grows with your needs.

## 2. HTTP - Response, Request

1. **Request**: Client's message asking the server for something, like a web page. It includes details like the URL and request method.

2. **Response**: The server's reply to the client's request, containing information such as a status code (e.g., 200 for success) and the requested content.

3. **Client-Server Interaction**: This describes the communication process where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds accordingly, forming the foundation of web interactions.

4. **Statelessness**: HTTP is stateless, meaning each request stands alone, and the server doesn't remember past interactions with the same client. Techniques like cookies or sessions help maintain state when needed.

## 3. Create Views, URL Configuration, and URL Mapping

1. **Views**: Views are like controllers in web development. They handle requests from users, process data if needed, and return appropriate responses. Views are typically Python functions or classes.

2. **URL Configuration**: URL configuration defines patterns for the URLs in your web application. It specifies which views should handle specific URL patterns. This configuration is often stored in a dedicated file, like Django's `urls.py`.

3. **URL Mapping**: URL mapping is the process of associating incoming URL requests with the appropriate views based on the defined URL patterns. It's the framework's job to match URLs to views, ensuring the right code is executed for each request.

4. **Request Routing**: When a user accesses a URL in your application, the web framework routes the request to the correct view using the URL mapping. This routing ensures that the right view function or class is called to generate the response, maintaining organized request handling.

## 4. Template System: Load and Render Templates

1. **Template Loading**: Django finds and loads HTML templates from a designated directory.

2. **Rendering Templates**: Views specify which template to use and pass data for dynamic content; Django combines templates and data to generate HTML responses.

3. **Template Tags and Filters**: Special constructs for logic and data manipulation within templates.

4. **Template Inheritance**: Allows for creating a base template with common elements and extending it in child templates for consistent layouts.
