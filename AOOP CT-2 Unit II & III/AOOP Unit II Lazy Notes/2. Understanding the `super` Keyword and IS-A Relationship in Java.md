**The `super` Keyword:**
1. **Differentiating Members:** When a subclass inherits from a superclass and both have members (variables or methods) with the same name, you can use the `super` keyword to distinguish them.
   ```java
   class Superclass {
       int num = 20;
       public void display() {
           System.out.println("Superclass display");
       }
   }

   class Subclass extends Superclass {
       int num = 10;
       public void display() {
           System.out.println("Subclass display");
           super.display(); // Calls the superclass's display method
           System.out.println("Subclass num: " + num);
           System.out.println("Superclass num: " + super.num);
       }
   }
   ```

**2. Invoking Superclass Constructor:** If you want to call a parameterized constructor of the superclass when creating an object of the subclass, you can use the `super` keyword.
   ```java
   class Superclass {
       int age;
       Superclass(int age) {
           this.age = age;
       }
   }

   class Subclass extends Superclass {
       Subclass(int age) {
           super(age); // Calls the superclass constructor
       }
   }
   ```

**IS-A Relationship:**
- In Java, the `extends` keyword is used to establish an IS-A relationship between classes. This means a subclass "is a" type of its superclass.
- For example, if you have classes like `Animal`, `Mammal` (which extends `Animal`), and `Dog` (which extends `Mammal`), you can say:
   - "A `Mammal` is an `Animal`."
   - "A `Dog` is a `Mammal`."
   - "A `Dog` is also an `Animal` because it inherits from both `Mammal` and `Animal`."
- You can use the `instanceof` operator to check if an object belongs to a specific class or its superclass.

```java
class Animal {}
class Mammal extends Animal {}
class Dog extends Mammal {}

public class Main {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Animal a = new Animal();
      Mammal m = new Mammal();
      Dog d = new Dog();

      System.out.println(m instanceof Animal); // true, because Mammal is an Animal
      System.out.println(d instanceof Mammal); // true, because Dog is a Mammal
      System.out.println(d instanceof Animal); // true, because Dog is an Animal
   }
}
```

In summary, the `super` keyword helps differentiate between members of a subclass and its superclass. The `extends` keyword establishes an IS-A relationship between classes, indicating that a subclass "is a" type of its superclass.
