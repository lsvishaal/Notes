**Primitive Data Structures:**
- Primitive data structures store data of only one type (e.g., int, float, char, pointer).
- They can hold a single type of value, such as an integer variable storing integer values.
- Examples of primitive data types include int, float, char, and pointers.
- Primitive data structures are known for their simplicity and efficiency, making them suitable for basic data storage and manipulation tasks.
- They have fixed sizes and memory requirements, which are known at compile time.
- Primitive data structures can be quickly accessed and operated upon.

**Non-Primitive Data Structures:**
- Non-primitive data structures can store data of different types within a single entity.
- They are user-defined and categorized into linear and non-linear data structures.
- Linear data structures store data sequentially, while non-linear data structures store data randomly.
- Examples of linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, which can hold elements of the same type or objects.
- Non-linear data structures include trees and graphs, offering more complex relationships between data elements.

**Examples of Linear Data Structures:**
1. **Array (Non-Primitive):** An array stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory. It supports operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
   ```java
   int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
   ```
   - Primitive data structures like `int` arrays store a single type (integers) in a fixed-size memory block.
   - Non-primitive data structures like object arrays can store objects of different types within the same array, providing flexibility.

2. **String (Non-Primitive):** A string is an array of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'). It is used to store text data.
   ```c
   char name[100] = "Hello, JavaTpoint";
   ```
   - In Java, the `String` class represents a non-primitive data structure for text storage.
   - Unlike primitive data types, `String` objects can store sequences of characters, making them versatile for text processing.

**Java Memory Allocation for Objects and Classes:**
- In Java, objects are instances of classes.
- When you create objects, memory is allocated to store their data.
- Each object of a class shares the same structure but can have different data values.
- For example, if you have a class `Book`, you can create multiple `Book` objects like `book1`, `book2`, and `book3`.
- Each object has its own set of instance variables (attributes) and methods.
- Memory allocation for objects is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
