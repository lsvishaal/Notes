**Method Overriding:**

1. **Benefit of Overriding:** Overriding allows a subclass to define its own behavior for a method inherited from its superclass, based on its specific requirements.

2. **Definition:** Overriding occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, parameters, and return type (or subtype) as a method in its superclass.

3. **Example:**
   ```java
   class Animal {
       public void move() {
           System.out.println("Animals can move");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       public void move() {
           System.out.println("Dogs can walk and run");
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Usage:** The method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type, not the reference type.

5. **Rules for Method Overriding:**
   - Argument list must be exactly the same as the overridden method.
   - Return type should be the same or a subtype.
   - Access level can't be more restrictive than the overridden method.
   - Instance methods can only override inherited methods.
   - `final` methods cannot be overridden.
   - `static` methods cannot be overridden, but they can be re-declared.
   - The overriding method can't throw broader checked exceptions than the overridden method.

**Using the `super` Keyword:**

1. The `super` keyword is used to invoke the superclass's version of an overridden method within the subclass.

2. Example:
   ```java
   class Dog extends Animal {
       public void move() {
           super.move(); // Invokes the superclass's move method
           System.out.println("Dogs can walk and run");
       }
   }
   ```

**Interfaces:**

1. An interface in Java is a reference type that contains a collection of abstract methods.

2. A class implements an interface, inheriting and providing concrete implementations for its methods.

3. An interface can also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

4. Interfaces provide full abstraction, and all interface methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.

5. A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can extend only one class.

6. When a class implements multiple interfaces with the same method name, it needs to provide an implementation for that method only once.

7. An interface cannot be instantiated, and all interface variables are `public`, `static`, and `final` by default.

8. Interfaces can extend other interfaces using the `extends` keyword.

9. A class can implement multiple interfaces separated by commas.

10. Interfaces are commonly used to define contracts for classes and enable multiple inheritance of types in Java.

11. Tagging interfaces have no methods and are used to add a data type to a class.

12. Interface methods are implicitly `public` and `abstract`, so they must be declared as `public` when implemented in a class.

13. Variables declared in interfaces are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`, and they must be initialized.

14. Interfaces can extend multiple interfaces, and classes can implement multiple interfaces.

15. An interface can extend another interface using the `extends` keyword.
